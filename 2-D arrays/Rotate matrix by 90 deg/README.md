# Problem

You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

## Note

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

# Solution

take transpose of matrix and then simply reverse 1st and last element of a row.
