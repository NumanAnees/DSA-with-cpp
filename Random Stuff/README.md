## Problem

```
Q1: write a function such that if we pass 100 it returns 101 and if we pass 101 it returns 100 without if else and ternary operator?
```

```
Q2: In what type of data to be searched, traversal of BST will be in worst case?
Ans: The time complexity for searching, inserting or deleting a node depends on the height of the tree h , so the worst case is O(h) in case of skewed trees.
```

```
Q3: Find **all** non repeating elements from Array O(N)?
Ans: use unordermap for counting occurances and then return elements where count is 1.
```

```
Q4: Flatten a nested array. e.g Input: [1, 2, [3, 4, 5, [6]], 7, 8]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

Ans:  use recursion with base case of if ith index is int not another array then add it into ans array.
Ans:  code....
```

```
Q5: Find frequency of characters in string . time complexity should be O(n) and space complexity O(1)?
Ans: code without using unordered_map....
```
