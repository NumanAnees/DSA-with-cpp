## Traversals

Total three main traversals in **DFS** but 1 in BFS which is level-wise.

### BFS

Breadth-First Search Algorithm or BFS is the most widely utilized method. BFS is a graph traversal approach in which you start at a source node and layer by layer through the graph, analyzing the nodes directly related to the source node. Then, in BFS traversal, you must move on to the next-level neighbor nodes.

### DFS

- In-Order
- Pre-Order
- Post-Order

### Note:

Just apply the formula of each on subtrees/child trees.

### Time Complexity

O(n)

### Space Complexity

O(h) which can be logn-to-n.
it will be n in case when tree is skewed(only 1 child).
